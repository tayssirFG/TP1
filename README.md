# TurtleBot Development Project

This repository contains the development files for a TurtleBot simulation project, including custom scripts for behavior and control, as well as custom Gazebo worlds for testing and navigation.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and enhancing the capabilities of a TurtleBot in a simulated environment using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Gazebo. The goal is to create an autonomous system that can navigate, interact with its environment, and perform specific tasks within a simulated world.

## Repository Structure

- **scripts/**: This directory contains custom scripts written in Python to control the TurtleBotâ€™s behavior, handle navigation tasks, and manage interactions.
- **worlds/**: This directory contains Gazebo `.world` files, defining different simulated environments for the TurtleBot to explore and interact within.
